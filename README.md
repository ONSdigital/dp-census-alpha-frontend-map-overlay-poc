## About the project
This is a Proof of Concept (POC) specifically this is a PROTOTYPE not production code, this code should never find its way to production. 
If it does something has gone seriously wrong. Not only is this a POC prototype but this is part of an Alpha project.

The goal of this POC is to discover a way to show boundary overlays specifically Local Authority. Whilst ideally being able to click an area and get the polygon coordinates.
